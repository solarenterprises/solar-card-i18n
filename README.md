# Public Repository for Internationalization (i18n) Files

Welcome to the public i18n repository for the Solar Card PWA! This repository contains all the language translation files used by the Solar Card Progressive Web Application (PWA). It is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions to improve translations or add new languages.
